What is this?

This is a driver for serial SPF touchscreen panels, such as the carrolltouch units from ELO.

For more information on the SPF standard, please see http://media.elotouch.com/pdfs/manuals/program.pdf

The generic sequence for initializing an SFP panel is as follows:

Send:
break
0x0D -> about 5 times, for auto baud detection
0x3C - Software reset
0x32 - Generate Error report
0x44 - Report Transfer

Receive:
F8 - Report header
00 - no errors
FF - end of report

Send panel options:
0x23 - coordinate reporting
0x26 or 0x27
( 0x29 ) - Add_exit_point_modifier - Sends a packet indicating finger removed
0x2A - Starts touch scanning

----
0x26 - Tracking mode - Sends only 1 packet per touch
0x27 - continuous mode - Sends continuously, even if no changes
----

The unit will now send a 4 Byte packet every time it is pressed:
0xFE or 0xFD
0xXX
0xYY
0xFF

0xFE = finger down, 0xFD = finger released.
